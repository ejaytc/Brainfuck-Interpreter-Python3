# Brainf*ck Interpreter
Simple interpreter written in Python3

### Definition
Brainfuck is a minimalistic esoteric programming language designed by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. It is characterized by its extremely simple syntax and minimalistic set of commands, making it challenging to write programs in but also a fascinating exercise in computational theory. Here are the full details of Brainfuck:

### Syntax and Commands
Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. It has a simple set of 8 commands, each represented by a single character:

1. **`>`**: Move the memory pointer to the right (increment the pointer).
2. **`<`**: Move the memory pointer to the left (decrement the pointer).
3. **`+`**: Increment the byte at the memory pointer.
4. **`-`**: Decrement the byte at the memory pointer.
5. **`.`**: Output the byte at the memory pointer as a character.
6. **`,`**: Input a character and store it in the byte at the memory pointer.
7. **`[`**: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the memory pointer is zero.
8. **`]`**: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the memory pointer is nonzero.

### Memory
- Brainfuck has an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero.
- The number of cells in the array can vary depending on the interpreter, but traditionally it starts at 30,000 cells.
- The cells are accessed by a data pointer that starts at the beginning of the array.

### Execution
- Brainfuck programs start execution from the first command (`>`).
- Commands are executed sequentially unless control flow (`[` and `]`) changes the execution order based on the value of the current memory cell.

### Language Characteristics
- **Minimalistic**: Brainfuck has one of the smallest instruction sets among programming languages.
- **Turing Completeness**: Despite its simplicity, Brainfuck is Turing-complete, meaning it can theoretically compute anything that a Turing machine can.
- **Esoteric**: It is primarily used for educational purposes, code golfing (writing the smallest possible programs), and entertainment rather than practical applications.

### Example Program
Here's an example of a Brainfuck program that prints "Hello World!":

```brainfuck
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```
Prints "Extended Ascii Chart":
```ASCII CHART EXTENDED
+.[+.]
```
